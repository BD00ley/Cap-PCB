# Cap-PCB
So this project was an attempt (and I emphasize attempt) to create a PCB that would display various messages on my cap for graduation.
However, I didn't read the datasheet of the ATTiny85 properly nor did I go too deep into the PCF8574 I/O expanders and everything about this
board is wrong (I somehow got the SDA and SCL lines backwards and I used the I/O expanders for current sources rather than sinks.)
So while this project did fail, I did learn the importance of triple checking schematics and really thoroughly reading through datasheets
rather than just skimming them.
